# David Personal Configuration files

There is an script that automatically installs all configuration files ```prepare_env.sh```, this will try to keep all old configuration files as ```name_of_the_file.old```. It does not test if you have feature X or Y installated, it will just copy all config files that may not adapt to your environment. Maybe it is best for you to create a fork.

## Vim

```.vim``` personal configuration file for vim.
