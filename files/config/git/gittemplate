# <type>[optional scope]: <description>
#
# [optional body]
#
# [optional footer]
#
# For type we could put several things: 
#
#   * **fix:** a commit of type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase
#   * **feat:** a commit of type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic verison)
#   * **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has the text `BREAKING CHANGE`: at the **beginning of its optinal body** or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with **MAJOR** in semantic versioning). A `BREAKING CHANGE` can be part of commits of any type.
#   * Other commits types than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, some recommendations are `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, among others.
